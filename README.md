# guild_msg_app
quick little messaging app written in python 


- Goal: 
    - An application that allows two users to send short text messages to each other

- Guidelines: 
    - Don't spend much time  
    - no accounts, users, registration, graphics or visual appeal 
    - it's perfectly fine to have one or two "hardcoded" accounts that simply work with each other
